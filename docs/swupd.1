.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBswupd [subcommand] <flags>\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBswupd\fP(1) is an OS\-level software update program that applies updates
to system software.
.sp
The updates are fetched from a central software update server. If a
valid update is found on the server, it can be downloaded and applied.
.sp
The \fBswupd\fP tool can also install and remove bundles, check for
updates without applying them, and perform system\-level verification of
the system software.
.sp
A \fIversion url\fP server provides version information. This server
notifies the program of available updates.
.sp
A \fIcontent url\fP server (can be the same as \fIversion url\fP server)
provides the file and metadata content for all versions. The content url
server provides metadata in the form of manifests. These Manifest files
list and describe file contents, symlinks, directories. Additionally,
the actual content is provided to clients in the form of archive files.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
The following options are applicable to most subcommands, and can be
used to modify the core behavior and resources that swupd uses.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-h, \-\-help\fP
.sp
Display general help information. If put after a subcommand, it will
display help specific to that subcommand.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-v, \-\-version\fP
.sp
Displays the version information of the swupd program, and exit. It also
displays compile options and copyright information.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-u, \-\-url={url}\fP
.sp
Specify an RFC\-3986 encoded url. The url will be used to download
version information and file content downloads.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-c, \-\-contenturl={url}\fP
.sp
Specify an RFC\-3986 encoded url. The url will be used for file
content downloads only.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-v, \-\-versionurl={url}\fP
.sp
Specify an RFC\-3986 encoded url. The url will be used to download
version information.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-P, \-\-port={port}\fP
.sp
Specify the port number of the server to connect to. Applies to both
version and file content url server connections.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-p, \-\-path={path}\fP
.sp
Specify the path to use for operations. This can be used to point to
a chroot installation of the OS or a custom mount.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-F, \-\-format={formatstring}\fP
.sp
Specify the format suffix for version file downloads. Is usually one
of \fB1\fP, \fB2\fP, \fB3\fP, etc. or \fBstaging\fP\&. Software update formats
may change regularly and normally you should consult the swupd server
data for the appropriate latest version available. If that version is
not supported by your version of \fBswupd\fP, you should subtract \fB1\fP
from the number and try again until it succeeds.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-f, \-\-force\fP
.sp
Forces completion of swupd beyond critical failures. This may ignore
filesystem errors, configuration errors and other errors which are
considered fatal, and could damage an installation if not addressed
properly.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-S, \-\-statedir={path}\fP
.sp
Specify an alternate swupd state directory. Normally \fBswupd\fP uses
\fB/var/lib/swupd\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.SH SUBCOMMANDS
.sp
\fBautoupdate [\-\-enable|\-\-disable]\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Enables or disables automatic updates, or reports current
status. Enabling updates does not cause an immediate update \-
use \fIswupd update\fP to force one if desired.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBbundle\-add {bundles}\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Installs new software bundles. Any bundle name listed after
\fIbundle\-list \-\-all\fP will be downloaded and installed.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBbundle\-remove {bundles}\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Removes software bundles. Any bundle name listed after \fIbundle\-remove\fP
will be removed from the system. If the bundle is required by another
bundle(s) on the system, a tree will be displayed to indicate which bundles
are blocking removal.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBbundle\-list\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
List all installed sofware bundles in the local system. Bundles available
can be listed with the \fI\-\-all\fP option.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\-a, \-\-all\fP
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
Lists all available software bundles, either installed or not, that
are available. It will return 0 with succeeded and a different value
of 0 with failed.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\-d, \-\-deps={bundle}\fP
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5

.IP \(bu 2
\fI\-D, \-\-has\-dep={bundle}\fP
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5

dependency. Combine with \fI\-\-all\fP to report all bundles including those
not installed on the system.

.sp
\fBcheck\-update\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

if so. Does not download update content.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBhashdump {path}\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Calculates and print the Manifest hash for a specific file on disk.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\-n \-\-no\-xattrs\fP

\fBsearch {string}\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Search for matching paths in manifest data. The specified {string}
is matched in any part of the path listed in manifests, and all
matches are printed, including the name of the bundle in which the
match was found.
.sp
If manifest data is not present in the state folder, it is
downloaded from the content url.
.sp
Because this search consults all manifests, it normally requires to
download all manifests for bundles that are not installed, and may
result in the download of several mega bytes of manifest data.

\fBupdate\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Performs a system software update.
.sp
The program will contact the version server at the version url, and
check to see if a system software update is available. If an update
is available, the update content will be downloaded from the content
url and stored in the \fI/var/lib/swupd\fP state path. Once all content
is downloaded and verified, the update is applied to the system.
.sp
In case any problem arises during a software update, the program
attempts to correct the issue, possibly by performing a \fIswupd verify \-\-fix\fP
operation, which corrects broken or missing files and other issues.
.sp
After the update is applied, the system performs an array of
post\-update actions. These actions are triggered through \fIsystemd(1)\fP
and reside in the \fIupdate\-triggers.target(4)\fP system target.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\-s, \-\-status\fP
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5

available on the version url server, and what version number is
available.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\-d, \-\-download\fP
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
Do not perform an update, instead download all resources needed
to perform the update, and exit.

.IP \(bu 2
\fI\-m, \-\-migrate\fP
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5

use content from both upstream, and the local system.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBverify\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Perform system software installation verification. The program will
obtain all the manifests needed from version url and content url to
establish whether the system software is correctly installed and not
overwritten, modified, missing or otherwise incorrect (permissions, etc.).
.sp
After obtaining the proper resources, all files that are under
control of the software update program are verified according to the
manifest data
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\-f, \-\-fix\fP

content, add missing files and do additional corrections, permissions
etc.

.IP \(bu 2
\fI\-i, \-\-install\fP
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
Install all files into {path} as specified by the \fI\-\-path={path}\fP
option. Useful to generate a new system root, or verify side
by side.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\-q, \-\-quick\fP
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
Omit checking hash values. Instead only corrects missing files
and directories and/or symlinks.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH EXIT STATUS
.sp
On success, 0 is returned. A non\-zero return code signals a failure.
.sp
If the subcommand \fBcheck\-update\fP was specified, the program returns
\fB0\fP if an update is available, \fB1\fP if no update available, and a
return value higher than \fB1\fP signals a failure.
.sp
If the subcommand was \fBautoupdate\fP without options, then the program
returns \fB0\fP if automatic updating is enabled.
